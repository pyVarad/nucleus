# Nucleus Design System

A **Design System** is a standardized framework that facilitates concurrent work among development teams by utilizing fundamental UI components from a centralized source. Its primary function is to empower development teams to concentrate on functional requirements, ensuring consistency in the behavior of components across various frameworks. 

Typically, Design Systems are constructed as a repository of reusable components. This approach centralizes design decision-making, ensuring uniformity and coherence throughout the development process. These decisions encompass themes, component behavior, event triggers, application style attributes, and quality guidelines, all of which are uniformly propagated across the system.
