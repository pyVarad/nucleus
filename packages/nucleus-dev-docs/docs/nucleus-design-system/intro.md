# Design System

A **Design System** is a standardized framework that facilitates concurrent work among development teams by utilizing fundamental UI components from a centralized source. Its primary function is to empower development teams to concentrate on functional requirements, ensuring consistency in the behavior of components across various frameworks. 

Typically, Design Systems are constructed as a repository of reusable components. This approach centralizes design decision-making, ensuring uniformity and coherence throughout the development process. These decisions encompass themes, component behavior, event triggers, application style attributes, and quality guidelines, all of which are uniformly propagated across the system.

### Nucleus Design System

The Nucleus Design System represents an endeavor to learn and construct a scalable design system fit for production-grade applications. Its development journey aims to comprehend various patterns of frontend development across different frameworks.

Microfrontends enable the integration of multiple frameworks within a unified portal. Consequently, there arises a crucial requirement for components and design elements that seamlessly span across these diverse frameworks.

Additionally, this pursuit is motivated by personal goals inspired by renowned design systems worldwide, such as Fluent, Carbon Design System, Material UI, Ant Design System, and several others.

Furthermore, this journey involves exploring strategies to extend a monorepo housing components designed for both web and mobile applications, employing technologies such as React Native or Ionic.
