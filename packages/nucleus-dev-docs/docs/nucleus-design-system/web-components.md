# Web Components

Web components offer a framework-agnostic method for crafting HTML-supported UI components. They are often the preferred approach for building a design system, primarily due to maintenance benefits. In the realm of frontend frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, Solid, and others, each framework has its unique methodology for component creation. However, managing multiple versions of a component across various frameworks while ensuring consistency in UI design becomes notably challenging.


### How can you build web components?

Building web components can be accomplished through various frameworks. An excellent resource for discovering these frameworks is the curated list available at [Awesome Web Components](https://github.com/web-padawan/awesome-web-components).


### Why StencilJS?

StencilJS is a popular framework for building web components and happens to be my personal choice as well. It boasts excellent documentation and benefits from a highly active community providing robust support. StencilJS also offers support for React, Angular, Vue, Ember, and plain JavaScript.
